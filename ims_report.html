                    <p>Management of inventory is done as a combination of two systems the traditional roster  
                        system and spreadsheet tools such as Google Sheets and MS Excel. The catalogues and                       
                        inventory listings are also manually recorded on physical paper that is not part of a single                         
                        or unified database. Tasks such as inter-department lending/borrowing, scrapping and                         
                        renewal are also done manually which can cause many issues such as redundancy, repetitive                         
                        entry or even undocumented transactions.

                    <p>This project's  prime focus is to establish an advanced system for record-keeping of  
                        inventory by the means of a software-based solution; Inventory Management System (IMS).  
                        This should reduce the problems surrounding manual management such as loss of time,  
                        quality of work, and maintenance cost(s) by the means of an organic fusion of Inventory  
                        Management and the IT environment. In the process of overcoming the challenges of  
                        traditional record keeping and developing a fast and efficient data recording tool. Equipped  
                        with secure login and simple forms for data entry. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Inventory management is the process of overseeing and controlling the ordering, storage, and use of materials, products,                        
                        and items in an organization. An inventory management system(IMS) is a software application that helps businesses track and                         
                        manage inventory levels, sales, deliveries, and other supply chain processes. With an IMS, businesses can increase efficiency, reduce  
                        costs, and provide customers with accurate information about product availability. IMS also helps businesses make informe
                        decisions about when to order products, how much to order, which products are selling well and which are not. In short, an 
                        IMS is a critical tool for streamlining supply chain operations and maximizing profits.
