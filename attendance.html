            <h1>Attendance Policy</h1>

            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>The attendance policy aims to promote regular attendance and active engagement among students in the AI&DS (Artificial Intelligence 
                and Data Science) Department at KJSIT College. It ensures that students have a comprehensive understanding of the subjects and fosters a 
                culture of discipline and responsibility. Additionally, the policy provides a mechanism for students to compensate for any shortfall in 
                individual attendance through extra assignments.
            </p>

            <h2>Attendance Requirements:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Overall Attendance: Students must maintain a minimum overall attendance of 75% in each semester to be eligible for appearing in the final examinations.</li> 
            </ul>



            <h2>Attendance Tracking:</h2>
            <ul >
                <li> Attendance Recording: Faculty members will record attendance for each class session accurately and promptly using an online attendance management system or any other designated method.</li>
                <li> Attendance Monitoring: The department will regularly review and monitor students' attendance records to identify those who fall below the prescribed attendance threshold.
            </ul>
            <h2>Attendance Deficiency:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Notification: Students falling below 75% attendance in any subject will be notified by the department through official channels, such as 
                    email or notice boards.</li>

               <!--<li>2. Extra Assignments: To compensate for attendance deficiencies in individual subjects, students will be required to complete extra assignments
                    related to those subjects. The assignments will be designed to ensure that students grasp the concepts missed due to low attendance. The specifics
                    of the assignments, including the number and nature, will be communicated by the respective subject faculty.</li>

                <li>3. Submission and Evaluation: Students must submit the extra assignments within a specified deadline. The faculty will evaluate the assignments
                    and allocate grades based on the quality of work submitted.</li>--> 

            </ul>
            <h2>Consequences of Non-Compliance:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Examination Ineligibility: Students failing to meet the 75% overall attendance requirement will be declared ineligible to appear for the final examination
                    of that subject.</li>

                <li> Disciplinary Action: Continued non-compliance with attendance requirements may result in disciplinary action as per the college's rules and regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Appeals and Grievances:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students who have legitimate grounds for their attendance deficiency or wish to appeal the decisions regarding extra assignments or attendance reassessment may
                        submit their grievances to the department. The department will provide a fair and transparent mechanism to address such appeals.</li>

                    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Note: This attendance policy serves as a guideline and may be subject to revision or modification by the department or college authorities as deemed necessary. 
                        It is important for students to stay updated with any changes communicated through official channels.</li>
