        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Established in the academic year 2020-2021, our department offers a comprehensive undergraduate program, 
            B.Tech Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This program is designed to provide students with knowledge
            and expertise in the rapidly growing fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS).</p>
        <p>
            AI-DS are interdisciplinary branches of science, engineering, and technology that are revolutionizing 
            various sectors of the technical industry, academia, and research. Our program focuses on equipping students with the
            necessary skills to create intelligent machines and develop real-world applications using data analytics and 
            visualization technologies.Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables computers to think and act like humans, while Deep Learning, a subset of ML, 
            allows machines to make decisions and think in a manner similar to humans. By integrating these technologies, 
            our students gain a deep understanding of AI and DS principles, enabling them to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation.</p>       
        <p>
            The field of Data Science plays a vital role in today's business landscape. With the exponential growth of data, businesses rely on advanced
            Big Data Analytics, statistical analysis, data extraction, manipulation, visualization, and data maintenance to identify trends, interpret
            results, and predict future outcomes.Our curriculum prepares students to be at the forefront of this data-driven revolution, empowering them to excel in the industry.</p>
